    "text": "While the Emissions Trading System(ETS) is not directly impacted by the EU Omnibus Package, secondary effects are likely due to related changes to the CSRD, CSDDD, and CBAM. Under the revised CSRD, the expected transition from limited assurance to reasonable assurance is no longer anticipated. Since ETS currently requires reasonable assurance, which involves a more rigorous audit process, this could lead to a shift toward limited assurance in order to reduce the reporting burden on companies and promote consistency with other standards. Additionally, updates to CBAM aimed at preventing circumvention may result in increased enforcement and stricter penalties for inaccurate reporting. The reduced scope of both the CSRD and CSDDD may also limit the availability of data needed to support and refine environmental policies such as the ETS."

    "text": "Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive(CSRD): An EU directive adopted on 28 November 2022, which revises several existing directives and regulations, including the Accounting Directive, Transparency Directive, Audit Directive, and Audit Regulation. The CSRD aims to improve the quality, consistency, and comparability of sustainability information disclosed by companies. Its primary goal is to provide investors and stakeholders with reliable data to assess and manage sustainability-related risks, especially those arising from climate change and social/environmental impacts. It also enforces double materiality, meaning companies must report both on how sustainability issues affect them and how their operations impact society and the environment.\nCorporate Sustainability Due Diligence Directive(CSDDD): An EU directive adopted on 24 April 2024, which requires certain large EU and non-EU companies to identify, prevent, mitigate, and account for adverse human rights and environmental impacts in their operations, subsidiaries, and value chains. The CSDDD introduces due diligence obligations, encouraging responsible business conduct throughout the supply chain, and includes provisions for climate transition planning aligned with the Paris Agreement.\nCarbon Border Adjust Mechanism(CBAM): A policy initiative adopted by the EU on 10 May 2023 aimed at preventing carbon leakage and promoting fair, sustainable trade. It imposes a carbon charge on certain imports from countries with generally less stringent climate policies, ensuring that imported goods meet environmental standards comparable to those within the EU.\nEU Taxonomy: Adopted on June 18, 2020, this framework was developed by the European Union to establish a classification system for environmentally sustainable economic activities. Its primary purpose is to direct investments toward initiatives that align with the EU’s climate and environmental goals, particularly the ambition of achieving climate neutrality by 2050. By providing sector-specific guidelines, the taxonomy helps investors, companies, and policymakers make well-informed, sustainable choices."

    "text": "This will later be split in to the tabs Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive(CSRD): Recent proposed amendments to the CSRD aim to narrow the scope of the directive by concentrating reporting obligations on larger undertakings. This adjustment is intended to alleviate the administrative burden on Small and Medium-sized Enterprises (SMEs), ensuring that sustainability reporting remains impactful without disproportionately affecting smaller businesses. It is estimated the 80% entities currently in scope of the directive will be exempted.\n\n\n\n\n\nCorporate Sustainability Due Diligence Directive(CSDDD): Proposals to change the CSDDD do not include changes in scope but rather removing the required reporting from indirect suppliers unless there is a clear indication of harm. This change aims to shield SMEs from what information can be required from suppliers and value chains.\nCarbon Border Adjustment Mechanism(CBAM): The proposed changes to CBAM largely work to lessen the financial and administrative burden of CBAM certification requirements on importers. The proposal if adopted, would exempt 90% of importers included in CBAM, while covering 99% of total emissions.\n\n\n\n\n\nEU Taxonomy: The proposed changes to the EU Taxonomy aim to reduce administrative burdens. Under current legislation, all companies within the CSRD scope are automatically subject to Taxonomy requirements, including full compliance with technical screening criteria. The proposal narrows the scope to the largest companies under CSDDD, introduces partial compliance, and allows CSRD companies below CSDDD thresholds to voluntarily opt-in for reporting."

The proposal postpones reporting deadlines under the CSRD and the CSDDD, allowing companies more time to prepare for the new disclosure requirements. Notably, there are no changes to the CSRD for Wave 1 and Wave 4 undertakings and issuers. The largest public-interest companies (Wave 1) are still required to report in 2025, based on financial years beginning on or after 1 January 2024."
