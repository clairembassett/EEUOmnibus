    "text": "While the Emissions Trading System(ETS) is not directly impacted by the EU Omnibus Package, secondary effects are likely due to related changes to the CSRD, CSDDD, and CBAM. Under the revised CSRD, the expected transition from limited assurance to reasonable assurance is no longer anticipated. Since ETS currently requires reasonable assurance, which involves a more rigorous audit process, this could lead to a shift toward limited assurance in order to reduce the reporting burden on companies and promote consistency with other standards. Additionally, updates to CBAM aimed at preventing circumvention may result in increased enforcement and stricter penalties for inaccurate reporting. The reduced scope of both the CSRD and CSDDD may also limit the availability of data needed to support and refine environmental policies such as the ETS."

    "text": "The Omnibus Package marks one of the first legislative steps toward reducing regulatory burdens within the EU. In the Budapest Declaration on the New European Competitiveness Deal, EU Heads of State and Government called for a “simplification revolution” aimed at creating a clear, streamlined, and business-friendly regulatory framework, with a particular focus on easing administrative, regulatory, and reporting burdens for SMEs. This initiative is driven by the broader goal of enhancing the competitiveness and resilience of EU businesses amid rapid global change and ongoing uncertainty linked to the Russia-Ukraine war.\nAgainst this backdrop, this report presents a comprehensive analysis of the EU Omnibus Package, drawing on detailed research to evaluate the potential impacts on both existing and prospective clients. As the regulatory environment within the European Union continues to evolve at a rapid pace, it is increasingly evident that the ability of clients to successfully navigate this complex and shifting landscape is becoming a crucial concern. The findings outlined here aim to highlight areas of change, anticipate emerging challenges, and help clients respond effectively to upcoming legislative developments.\nBelow is a summary of the key legislations that will be affected by the EU Omnibus Package:\n\n\n\nCorporate Sustainability Reporting Directive\n\n\n\nAn EU directive adopted on 28 November 2022, which revises several existing directives and regulations, including the Accounting Directive, Transparency Directive, Audit Directive, and Audit Regulation. The CSRD aims to improve the quality, consistency, and comparability of sustainability information disclosed by companies. Its primary goal is to provide investors and stakeholders with reliable data to assess and manage sustainability-related risks, especially those arising from climate change and social/environmental impacts. It also enforces double materiality, meaning companies must report both on how sustainability issues affect them and how their operations impact society and the environment.\n\n\n\n\nCorporate Sustainability Due Diligence Directive\n\n\n\nAn EU directive adopted on 24 April 2024, which requires certain large EU and non-EU companies to identify, prevent, mitigate, and account for adverse human rights and environmental impacts in their operations, subsidiaries, and value chains. The CSDDD introduces due diligence obligations, encouraging responsible business conduct throughout the supply chain, and includes provisions for climate transition planning aligned with the Paris Agreement.\n\n\n\n\nEU Taxonomy\n\n\n\nAdopted on June 18, 2020, this framework was developed by the European Union to establish a classification system for environmentally sustainable economic activities. Its primary purpose is to direct investments toward initiatives that align with the EU’s climate and environmental goals, particularly the ambition of achieving climate neutrality by 2050. By providing sector-specific guidelines, the taxonomy helps investors, companies, and policymakers make well-informed, sustainable choices. These are the current steps for companies to report under EU Taxonomy.\n\n\n\nCompanies must align their activities with six environmental objectives and ensure they meet the “Do No Significant Harm” (DNSH) criteria, which means their activities must not significantly harm any of these objectives.\n\n\n\n\n\nCarbon Border Adjustment Mechanism\n\n\n\nA policy initiative adopted by the EU on 10 May 2023 aimed at preventing carbon leakage and promoting fair, sustainable trade. It imposes a carbon charge on certain imports from countries with generally less stringent climate policies, ensuring that imported goods meet environmental standards comparable to those within the EU."

The proposal postpones reporting deadlines under the CSRD and the CSDDD, allowing companies more time to prepare for the new disclosure requirements. Notably, there are no changes to the CSRD for Wave 1 and Wave 4 undertakings and issuers. The largest public-interest companies (Wave 1) are still required to report in 2025, based on financial years beginning on or after 1 January 2024."

Under the revised de minimis exemption, if a company imports fewer than 50 tonnes of goods, CBAM allowances would not apply. However, such a low volume is unlikely given current production levels.\nChanges to certificate pricing may slightly affect costs, as tying certificate prices to weekly market rates will align them more closely with actual market conditions. Starting in 2027, companies will only need to surrender certificates covering 50 percent of emissions from imported goods. Additionally, reporting for 2026 imports will not be due until February 2027, giving companies additional time to comply with the new requirements.\nThe option to hire a third party to submit CBAM declarations may also present a business opportunity. The updated default values will reduce the cost of certificates when emissions data is unavailable, making a lack of emission data less punitive. Emission calculations will now exclude certain finishing processes in the steel industry, which may effect certain products in production. Finally, the new anti-circumvention clause increases exposure for companies attempting to exploit the system and deters efforts to avoid CBAM obligations."

    "text": "EU Taxonomy:\nThe proposed changes to the EU Taxonomy aim to reduce administrative burdens. Under current legislation, all companies within the CSRD scope are automatically subject to Taxonomy requirements, including full compliance with technical screening criteria. The proposal narrows the scope to the largest companies under CSDDD, introduces partial compliance, and allows CSRD companies below CSDDD thresholds to voluntarily opt-in for reporting. The reporting guidelines and process remains unchanged."

    "text": "Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive(CSRD): An EU directive adopted on 28 November 2022, which revises several existing directives and regulations, including the Accounting Directive, Transparency Directive, Audit Directive, and Audit Regulation. The CSRD aims to improve the quality, consistency, and comparability of sustainability information disclosed by companies. Its primary goal is to provide investors and stakeholders with reliable data to assess and manage sustainability-related risks, especially those arising from climate change and social/environmental impacts. It also enforces double materiality, meaning companies must report both on how sustainability issues affect them and how their operations impact society and the environment."
