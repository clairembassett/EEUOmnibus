**Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive(CSRD):** An EU directive adopted on 28 November 2022, which revises several existing directives and regulations, including the Accounting Directive, Transparency Directive, Audit Directive, and Audit Regulation. The CSRD aims to improve the quality, consistency, and comparability of sustainability information disclosed by companies. Its primary goal is to provide investors and stakeholders with reliable data to assess and manage sustainability-related risks, especially those arising from climate change and social/environmental impacts. It also enforces double materiality, meaning companies must report both on how sustainability issues affect them and how their operations impact society and the environment.

**Corporate Sustainability Due Diligence Directive(CSDDD):** An EU directive adopted on 24 April 2024, which requires certain large EU and non-EU companies to identify, prevent, mitigate, and account for adverse human rights and environmental impacts in their operations, subsidiaries, and value chains. The CSDDD introduces due diligence obligations, encouraging responsible business conduct throughout the supply chain, and includes provisions for climate transition planning aligned with the Paris Agreement.

**Carbon Border Adjust Mechanism(CBAM):** A policy initiative adopted by the EU on 10 May 2023 aimed at preventing carbon leakage and promoting fair, sustainable trade. It imposes a carbon charge on certain imports from countries with generally less stringent climate policies, ensuring that imported goods meet environmental standards comparable to those within the EU.

**EU Taxonomy:** Adopted on June 18, 2020, this framework was developed by the European Union to establish a classification system for environmentally sustainable economic activities. Its primary purpose is to direct investments toward initiatives that align with the EU's climate and environmental goals, particularly the ambition of achieving climate neutrality by 2050. By providing sector-specific guidelines, the taxonomy helps investors, companies, and policymakers make well-informed, sustainable choices. These are the current steps for companies to report under EU Taxonomy.
