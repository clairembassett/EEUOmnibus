**Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive(CSRD):** An EU directive adopted on 28 November 2022, which revises several existing directives and regulations, including the Accounting Directive, Transparency Directive, Audit Directive, and Audit Regulation. The CSRD aims to improve the quality, consistency, and comparability of sustainability information disclosed by companies. Its primary goal is to provide investors and stakeholders with reliable data to assess and manage sustainability-related risks, especially those arising from climate change and social/environmental impacts. It also enforces double materiality, meaning companies must report both on how sustainability issues affect them and how their operations impact society and the environment.
