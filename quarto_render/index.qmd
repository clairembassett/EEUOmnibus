The Omnibus Package marks one of the first legislative steps toward reducing regulatory burdens within the EU. In the Budapest Declaration on the New European Competitiveness Deal, EU Heads of State and Government called for a “simplification revolution” aimed at creating a clear, streamlined, and business-friendly regulatory framework, with a particular focus on easing administrative, regulatory, and reporting burdens for SMEs. This initiative is driven by the broader goal of enhancing the competitiveness and resilience of EU businesses amid rapid global change and ongoing uncertainty linked to the Russia-Ukraine war.

Against this backdrop, this report presents a comprehensive analysis of the EU Omnibus Package, drawing on detailed research to evaluate the potential impacts on both existing and prospective clients. As the regulatory environment within the European Union continues to evolve at a rapid pace, it is increasingly evident that the ability of clients to successfully navigate this complex and shifting landscape is becoming a crucial concern. The findings outlined here aim to highlight areas of change, anticipate emerging challenges, and help clients respond effectively to upcoming legislative developments.
