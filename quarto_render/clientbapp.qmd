# Client B Case Study

A past client only referred to as Company B will be used as a case study on how the EU Omnibus package may effect current and future clients. The EU Net Turnover could not be found, but is likely below the threshold to be affected by the CSDDD. Though, for this application it is assumed to be above 450k to show how the proposed changes may take effect. The UK Steel Company has the below company statistics:

## Published Company Statistics in 2024:

*All monetary values were converted from British Pound GBP to Euros using the 2024 average exchange rate of 1.811(Exchange-rates.org, 2024) and then slightly altered for anonymity.


## Application of Case Study to the “Stop the Clock” Proposal:
**Approved Changes to the CSRD:**

![](coBCSRD.png){fig-align="center"}


Company B is classified as a Wave 1 company, as it significantly exceeds both thresholds: employing over 500 people and reporting a net turnover of more than €40 million. As the company is classified as Wave 1, it is not affected by the proposal and is still required to report in 2025 for financial years beginning on or after January 1, 2024.

**Approved Changes to the CSDDD:**

![](coBCSDDD.png){fig-align="center"}

Though, Company B likely does not meet the threshold for meeting the CSDDD the EU Net Turnover has been altered to provide an example of effects of the proposed changes to the CSDDD. Company B must report from 26th July, 2029 according to the Stop the Clock Proposal.


## Application of Case Study to Proposed Changes:
**Proposed Changes to the CSRD:**

![](coACSRDprop.png){fig-align="center"}

As Company B is a Wave 1 company under the CSRD and already required to report, it will not experience any changes to the reporting content or timeline. The only change is confirmation that assurance requirements will not be increase to reasonable assurance.

**Proposed Changes to the CSDDD:**

The proposed changes to the CSDDD aim to reduce administrative burden on companies. It is clear that these changes will achieve this goal while still holding companies responsible for due dilligence reporting.

**Proposed Changes to EU Taxonomy:**

Since Company B qualifies as reporters for both the CSRD and CSDDD, they are subject to EU Taxonomy sustainability reporting requirements.
 However, it can choose to opt-in to taxonomy reporting. If Company A chooses not to claim any of its economic activities as environmentally sustainable under the EU Taxonomy, it is not required to report taxonomy KPIs. However, in doing so, it forfeits the ability to present itself as environmentally sustainable under the Taxonomy framework.

If the company opts to report under the EU Taxonomy, they will need to provide data on company turnover, Since we do not currently have access to these figures, a recommended tool, either for the company’s own use or to assist in estimating the share of funds aligned with the EU Taxonomy, is provided below:
